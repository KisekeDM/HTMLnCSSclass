<h1 style="color: white;font-family: monospace"><u><b>THE COLOUR 'BLACK'</u></b></h1>
<p style="color: white">Black is a color which results from the absence or complete absorption of visible light. It is an achromatic color, without hue, like white and <b>[1]</b> It is often used symbolically or figuratively to represent darkness.<b>[2]</b> Black and white have often been used to describe opposites such as good and evil, the Dark Ages versus Age of Enlightenment, and night versus day. Since the Middle Ages, black has been the symbolic color of solemnity and authority, and for this reason it is still commonly worn by judges and magistrates.<b>[3]</b>

Black was one of the first colors used by artists in Neolithic cave paintings.<b>[4]</b> It was used in ancient Egypt and Greece as the color of the underworld.<b>[5]</b> In the Roman Empire, it became the color of mourning, and over the centuries it was frequently associated with death, evil, witches, and magic.<b>[6]</b> In the 14th century, it was worn by royalty, clergy, judges, and government officials in much of Europe. It became the color worn by English romantic poets, businessmen and statesmen in the 19th century, and a high fashion color in the 20th century.<b>[7]</b> According to surveys in Europe and North America, it is the color most commonly associated with mourning, the end, secrets, magic, force, violence, fear, evil, and elegance.<b>[8]</b>

Black is the most common ink color used for printing books, newspapers and documents, as it provides the highest contrast with white paper and thus is the easiest color to read. Similarly, black text on a white screen is the most common format used on computer screens.<b>[9]</b> As of September 2019, the darkest material is made by MIT engineers from vertically aligned carbon nanotubes.<b>[10]</b></p>

<h1 style="color: white;font-family: monospace"><u><b>SHADES OF BLACK</u></b></h1>
<p style="color: white">Shades of black are colors that differ only slightly from pure black. These colors have a low lightness. From a photometric point of view, a color which differs slightly from black always has low relative luminance. Variations of black include what are commonly termed off-black colors, which may be considered part of a neutral color scheme, usually in interior design as a part of a background for brighter colors. Black and dark gray colors are powerful accent colors that suggest weight, dignity, formality, and solemnity.[1]

In color theory, a shade is a pure color mixed with black. It decreases its lightness while nearly conserving its chromaticity. Strictly speaking, a "shade of black" is always a pure black itself and a "tint of black" would be a neutral gray. Unlike these, many off-black colors possess a hue and a colorfulness (also called saturation).

Colors often considered "shades of black" include onyx, black olive, charcoal, and jet. </p>
